JavaScript ToDoList

Skipping the HTML/ CSS.

Javascript Dom at this time was something new that I was intersted in. Changing Html to a more responsive web page? Yes, thank you. Anytime i view code im just fascinated by how it all works. How all these parts just mesh together. Im very curious as to how the parameter of function worksin the .addEventListener(); also "appendChild();".
